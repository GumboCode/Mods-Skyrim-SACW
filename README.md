1. Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE64): https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30379

2. Extract the contents of the .zip file into Skyrim's Data directory. ( "Skyrim Special Edition\Data\" )


The Skyrim Special Edition folder location depends on what platform you installed it from. For Steam its in the ( "Steam\steamapps\common\" ) folder.

1. Boot up the game.
2. You may need to go to Creations and Load Order to enable the mod.
3. While in the game, pause and go to System > Mod Configuration.

6. Go back to the mod configuration menu and look for Simple Add CW in the list.
